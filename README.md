Hiking with (free) Offline Maps. <br>

Xamarin Android Project, using a number of 3rd party libraries. Without these libraries, this project would not have seen the day of light.

This is a work in progress. Please fork and submit PR's to improve and add (much) needed functionality. If you can contribute, and would like an iOS version,
please reach out and we'll migrate it to Xamarin.Forms.

# History
Project is a result of ViewRanger changing owners and being replaced by a new app, but offline maps is no longer a free feature.
Dedicated GPS devices are not free, but most people either have access, or know someone with an Android phone. Having access to basic (free) maps and overlay routes
is a valuable aid to gain confidence and enjoy the outdoor.
